# Algorithms

Internally, rllib uses the terminology of Trainable, Algorithms, Agents depending on the context in which it is used. In this repository, we will consistently use the terminology of "Algorithms" to refer to these Trainables/Agents.

The list of algorithms available out of the box in rllib are available here : https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib-algorithms.html
